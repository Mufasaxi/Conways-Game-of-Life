# Overview
Running the source code will start the simulation.
The simulation can be controlled in the following ways:
* Pressing SPACEBAR or the Pause / Resume button will stop and start the simulation.
* Pressing G (on keyboard or on screen) will randomly generate a new simulation.
* Pressing C (on keyboard or on screen) will clear the grid.
* While paused, you can click on cells to turn them on, once a cell is on it can't be manually turned off.
